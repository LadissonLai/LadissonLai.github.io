I'm a second-year master's student studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. My research interests mainly revolve around Computer Vision, Multi-Modal Learning, and Autonomous Systems. I am excited about developing innovative AI solutions that transcend theoretical boundaries and address tangible real-world challenges. 

Currently, I am working on my master's thesis, where we try to leverage the vast amount of encyclopedic knowledge contained within large language models for tasks in the computer vision domain. This project is carried out in cooperation with TNO's [Intelligent Imaging Group](https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/organisation/units/defence-safety-security/intelligent-imaging/) and under the joint supervision of [Gertjan Burghouts](https://gertjanburghouts.github.io/), [Yuki Asano](https://yukimasano.github.io/), and [Serge Belongie](https://sergebelongie.github.io).

I am actively looking for PhD positions at the moment.
